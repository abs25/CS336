Make sure that you can explain:
   1. the component structure of the application. What makes the UI composable and why does this matter?
   	The component structure defines the order of the page and which components parent other components. The UI is composable because it is maintainable and modular. This matters because it makes the UI easy to edit and maintain.
   2. what JSX does.
    JSX is composed of XML-styled components. They are easier to read than plain JavaScript. JSX is a way to add components to the page.
   3. how the data flows through the components; how are comments loaded? created? saved?
    Comments are loaded from the server through the CommentBox component. They are created in the CommentForm component, and sent to the server through the CommentBox component.
   4. the nature and purpose of props and state; which is immutable and which is mutable and why does this distinction matter?
    Props are immutable (they are passed from the parent and "owned" by the parent). State is mutable and can be changed by calling this.setState(). This distinction means that while state can change, properties will not change.

Consider the following, more detailed questions based on statements in the tutorial.
   1. Try editing the comments.json file (to add or remove a legal comment). What happens and why?
    Comments are removed or added, respectively. This happens because the CommentBox is loading the comments from the JSON file. If they're not there, they can't be loaded.
   2. When the CommentBox has loaded comments from the server (in loadCommentsFromServer()), why doesn’t it call render() to make them visible?
    It doesn't call render() because the actual rendering is happening in the CommentList component. All CommentBox does is set the state.
   3. Why should components always represent the current state of the view?
    So the state of the view does not differ from the state of the component. This way, the actual DOM doesn't differ from that of the component.
   4. The app implements optimistic updates. Isn’t optimism here more like foolishness? What if the server rejects the new comment (for whatever reason)?
    If the server rejects it, the comment won't get added, so if the page is reloaded, the comment will go away.
